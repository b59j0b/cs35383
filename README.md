(e) Show that the first h ki and second moment  of the binomial distribution PB(k) obtained in (b) are the same as the first h ki and second  moments of the Poisson distribution PP (k) obtained in (d), as long as  with c constant and N → ∞.
• 2. A given random network
Consider a random network in the ensemble G(N, p) with N = 4 × 106 nodes and a linking probability p = 10−4.
(a) Calculate the average degree h ki of this network.
(b) Calculate the standard deviation σP using the approximated degree distribution given by Eq. (2).


(c) Assume that you observe a node with degree 2 × 103 . How many standard deviations is this observation from the mean? Is this an expected observation or is this an unexpected observation?
